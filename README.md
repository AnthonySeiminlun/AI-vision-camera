**AI Vsion Camera**

Blind and visually impaired individuals often face significant challenges in independently
identifying objects, locating obstacles, and accessing printed text. This project aims to
address these challenges by designing a prototype that enables blind individuals to "see"
without sight. The prototype focuses on empowering users to identify and locate objects,
avoid obstacles, and read textual content without relying on Braille. With this innovation,
blind individuals will gain greater independence, such as reading restaurant menus or
books not written in Braille, thereby enhancing their quality of life.


**Objective**
Capture and describe image .Utilise the camera to click the image of objects ,scenes or documents.
Provide Environmental Awareness:
Detect and describe the surrounding environment, enhancing situational awareness.
Facilitate Independent Reading:
Enable users to read printed text such as books or menus directly, without relying on braille translations.
Deliver Audio Feedback:
Convert the analyzed content into audio output for real-time user feedback
